Simple implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes in Java
------------------------------------------------------

 The main requirement of this program is a dynamic data structure for which arraylist servers the purpose. Arraylist holds object references. Integer wrapper class is used here.

Logic
----

1) Generate a list which contains numbers from 2 to n  where n is the limit specified by the user.
2) Let p be the first prime number .(which is 2 ).
3) Remove from the list, those elements which are multiples of p.
4) The number next to the previous prime number is the next prime.Let it be ‘q’.
5) If square of q is lesser than or equal to the limit,remove the multiples of q from the list and go to step 4,else stop.
6) The final list consists of prime numbers only.
